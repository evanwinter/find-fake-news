# Fake News Finder 


## Objective

Starting with Politifact's database of 200+ websites found to have published deliberately false or fake stories, watch for new Tweets linking back to those websites.

Track the spread of stories on social media to better understand how fake news stories spread.

## Politifact's Database

From Politifact: "To help you better sort out fact from fiction on the Internet we created this list of websites where we've found **deliberately false or fake stories. This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers**, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one."

## To Do

* Use NLP to determine the nature of tweets ("I agree with/believe this story" versus "Look at this dumb/fake article")
* Data visualization –– on a map, show where these tweets are coming from and how they spread
* Incorporate capacity to 'learn' new problem domains, add them to list of domains to watch for
